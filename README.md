This project is to implement various Learning algorithms to evaluate the policy "Hit if sum of cards is below 17, and Stand otherwise."

Start the program by typing
> python blackjack.py


This application supports 3 policy evaluation techniques.

- MC - Monte Carlo policy evaluation
- TD - Temporal-Difference policy evalutaion
- QL - Q-Learning

By clicking each of these button, you will start learning simulation. The numbers denoted as "MC-Utility of Current State" and "TD-Utility of Current State" refer to the current state's score under learning algorithms. "Q values" specifically guide the user by displaying scores for each action. Play button automatically play the game with the learned Q values.


This project was a part of academic coursework in UC San Diego.
